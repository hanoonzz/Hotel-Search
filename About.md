#Hotel-Search
Hotel-Search is a simple java web application with Spring MVC

##Why I chose JAVA? 
I have around two years of experience in building web application with asp.net MVC and C#
and I choose Java for the similarities between the two frameworks
in addition to being familiar with JAVA from university courses and projects 
also, this is my first time building web application with java and using spring framework
